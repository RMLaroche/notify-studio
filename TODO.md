## Current Focus

**Priority:** Platform backend setup to receive CLI messages

**Goal:** Set up Express server with SQLite database and REST/WebSocket endpoints to receive messages from CLI client.

**Next Steps:**
1. Initialize platform backend with proper structure
2. Set up SQLite database with schema and migrations
3. Create REST API endpoints (auth, clients, modules, alerts)
4. Implement WebSocket handling for real-time streaming
5. Test full client â†’ platform â†’ module flow

## CLI Client Features Completed âœ…

- **Offline queuing** with local file storage
- **Command execution** with stdout/stderr capture
- **Pipe integration** for command output redirection
- **File watching** for log monitoring
- **WebSocket streaming** for real-time logs
- **REST alerts** for one-time messages
- **Auto-reconnection** with retry logic
- **Configuration file** support
